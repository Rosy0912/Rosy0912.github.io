I completed my undergraduate studies at Chien-Shiung Wu College, Southeast University (985 & 211), majoring in Artificial Intelligence, and graduated in 2024. Afterwards, I was admitted without examination to the Master’s program in Cyberspace Security at Beijing Electronic Science and Technology Institute, initially leaning toward a civil service career after early research setbacks. However, I was fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Xiaojun Jia](http://jiaxiaojunqaq.github.io/), a postdoctoral researcher at Nanyang Technological University, and to collaborate with [Weixin Wang](https://weixinwilliamwang.github.io/weixinwang.github.io/), [Haoxuan Ma](https://hunter-wrynn.github.io/), and many other friends. These experiences reignited my passion for academia and inspired me to pursue a Ph.D.
